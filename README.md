# Learning CS229

### Introduction 💡
The repo records my solutions to all assignments and projects of Stanford CS229 Fall 2017. <br>
The main learning materials are Fall 2018 class notes and CS229 open course videos.

You can open a new issue or send me a email if you find any mistakes.

The course page is here. http://cs229.stanford.edu/syllabus.html
